# Stephens Scripts
### DyslexicBackups
- I made this script to backup my obsidian vault. It takes my designated notes folder and makes a tarball that I then encrypt with a password using gpg then push the encrypted tarball to a remote github repo. I set it up a systemd service for my user to run the script every time I log on. In the future I plan on adding some more functionality like a user setup script and menu that allows you to take whatever directories you'd like to have backed up to a remote encrypted git repo and loop through them to back them all up.
- The reason I made this is instead of using regular cloud provided encrypted storage is because I have a deeply ingrained disdain for nonconsentual data harvesting and the subsequent selling of it that pretty much all of the big tech overlords do at this point. I wanted a way to get access to my backups from the command line that I can pull from any machine and unpack it. This achieves the privacy aspect by locally encrypting your archive before you upload it, and by using symmetric encryption it makes the backups completely mobile while being accessible from almost any PC and cli utilities (git, tar, and gpg is all you need).
